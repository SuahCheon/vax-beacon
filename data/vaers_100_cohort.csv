Patient was in her usual state of health until 3/1/2021, when she developed sudden-onset pain ""across the entire chest"".  She shares that her symptoms ""came out of the blue"", as ""suddenly one day, everything just hurt"".  She saw her primary care physician, who initially felt her symptoms were due to acid reflux.  As such, the patient started ""eating antacids and omeprazole like candy"".  However, her chest pain persisted, prompting her to follow up with her primary care physician on 3/16/2021.  At that time, ECG reportedly showed normal sinus rhythm and no acute changes.  CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast showed abnormal enhancement and thickening of the pericardium with trace pericardial fluid, consistent with pericarditis.  The patient was therefore started on colchicine and an ibuprofen taper.   On 4/5/2021, Patient sent a myVM portal message to her primary care physician and cardiologist, expressing her belief that her chest pain has remained unchanged over the past month.  She continues to experience a constant burning sensation throughout her chest, aggravated by deep inspiration and alleviated by lying flat on her back.  She shares that walking up the stairs at home leaves her ""breathless"".  Associated symptoms include subjective fevers, chills, and night sweats.  Given these symptoms, Patient underwent a chest x-ray, which showed findings consistent with an enlarging pericardial effusion.  Patient was then advised to present to the ED for further workup as an inpatient.   At time of hospital admission, patient endorses persistent chest pain during inspiration.  Prior to 3/1/2021, she has never experienced these symptoms and reports no history of pericarditis.  The most strenuous physical activity she has undertaken in the last month include working in the garden and caring light boxes down the stairs.

Additionally reported in Pediatrics, 2021, entitled Myocarditis after SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination: True, True, and Related? with DOI: 10.1542/peds.2021-052644 via contactable Physicians. This Physician reported similar events for seven patients. This is the sixth of seven reports. Introduction: On 11Dec2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine for prevention of COVID-19 for individuals 16 years of age and older.1. On 10May2021, the FDA revised the EUA for this vaccine to include children 12 years and older. The Pfizer vaccine remains the only vaccine with an EUA for 12-to 17-year-old children. This vaccine demonstrated 94-95% efficacy in preventing COVID-19 infection in 16- 55-year-old participants, and 100% efficacy in the 12-15 years old age group. Systemic reactogenicity occurred more commonly in younger patients and after the second dose of vaccine. Post-immunization myocarditis is a known rare adverse event following other vaccinations, particularly following smallpox vaccination. Recently the news media has highlighted reports of myocarditis after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination involving United States (US) military patients and patients from Israel. The Israeli cohort identified a male predominance with an incidence of 1/20,000 (men aged 18 to 30 years old). However, a conclusive causal link to vaccination has not been confirmed at this time. Additionally, two recently published European case reports describe myocarditis after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in a 56-year-old man with previous COVID-19 and a 39-year-old man with no history of COVID-19. This report summarizes case histories of 7 healthy male adolescents 14 to 19 years of age who developed acute myocarditis or pericarditis within 4 days after receiving the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, none of whom met criteria for MIS-C. All 7 patients were vaccinated in April and May of 2021 and have been reported to VAERS. Patient 6: A 16-year-old previously well male was admitted with a chief complaint of chest pain. His initial symptoms began 3 days after the second Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine with malaise and subjective fever. He had no recent or remote history of viral illness, and no known COVID-19 exposures. The night prior to admission he developed acute midsternal chest pain that lasted for approximately 18 hours. Evaluation in the ED showed an elevated troponin T (0.66 ng/mL, normal range, <0.01 ng/mL), ST-elevation on ECG but normal function and structure on echocardiogram. Cardiac MRI demonstrated diffuse edema and subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement. A nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR was negative and antibody testing showed positive spike and negative nucleocapsid antibodies for SARS-CoV-2. He was treated with 70 grams IVIG and started on prednisone 30 mg orally twice daily with a gradual taper over 4 weeks. He did not receive any non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). Troponin T climbed after admission and remained elevated throughout the hospitalization. Chest pain resolved after administration of 6 mg of morphine in the initial ED evaluation. Telemetry was normal throughout hospitalization. He was discharged 3 days after admission. He had not yet returned for follow-up visit at the time of this submission. Exposure to COVID-19 in 14 days prior to illness onset was None. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included activated partial thromboplastin time prolonged: 27.9 seconds, alanine aminotransferase: 22 (units/L), antibody test negative: negative, antibody test positive: antibody testing showed positive spike and negative nucleocapsid antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, aspartate aminotransferase: 59 (units/L), blood albumin: 3.8 g/dl, body mass index: 22, brain natriuretic peptide increased: 149 pg/ml, c-reactive protein: 1.5 mg/dl, c-reactive protein increased: 1.8 mg/dl, cytomegalovirus test negative: negative, echocardiogram: normal, electrocardiogram: st-elevated, ST-elevation on ECG but normal function, enterovirus test negative: negative, epstein-barr virus antibody negative: negative, International Normalized Ratio INR: 1.06, Other diagnostics: Negative Lyme serology, negative Mycoplasma serum PCR, negative Parvovirus serum PCR, Absolute lymphocyte count: 1.4/mm3, Absolute neutrophil: 2.8 /mm3, Platelet count: 189, Mycoplasma serum PCR: Negative, Respiratory pathogen panel PCR: Negative, Prothrombin time: 11.4 seconds, Erythrocyte sedimentation rate: 3 (mm/hr), COVID-19 spike antibody: Positive, Ferritin: 65 ug/L, Highest troponin: 0.82 ng/ml, Lowest troponin prior to Discharge: 0.01 ng/ml, Peripheral white blood cell count: 5.0. Discussion: Author report 7 cases of clinical myocarditis or myopericarditis that developed in 14 to 19-year-old males within 4 days of receiving the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine with no evidence of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and who did not fulfill criteria for MIS-C. Extensive diagnostic evaluation for other myocarditis etiologies was negative, including respiratory pathogens from nasopharyngeal swabs, serum PCR tests, and infectious serologies. Additionally, all cardiac MRIs were diagnostic for myocarditis based on the modified Lake Louise criteria rather than MIS-C characteristics described by (withheld) et al (diffuse myocardial edema without evidence of late gadolinium enhancement). There was some suggestion of abnormal left ventricular myocardial echocardiographic strain corresponding to regions of myocardial necrosis on cardiac MRI. All patients in this series had myocarditis or myopericarditis, which is the term for diagnosis of both myocardial and pericardial inflammation. These terms are often used interchangeably, which can make surveillance of these diseases challenging. Myocarditis and pericarditis are rare diseases. The true baseline incidence of myocarditis is unknown and varies by season, geography, and age: it has been reported to occur in 1.95/100,000 person- years in children <15 years of age in Finland and in 2.16 cases per 100,000 US military service members in a 30-day period. It is more common in males, and among children demonstrates a bimodal incidence pattern, with peaks at <2 years of age and in adolescence. An evaluation for potential viral causes is recommended, although a cause is usually not found. There have been prior reports of myocarditis following smallpox vaccination10. In patients with myocarditis, restriction from competitive sports is recommended for at least 3 months until cleared by a cardiologist in order to avoid sudden cardiac events while the heart muscle recovers. Less is known about the true incidence of pericarditis. Pericarditis can occur in the setting of a variety of infectious and non-infectious illnesses. In a study of patients more than16 years of age in Finland, the incidence rate of hospitalizations for acute pericarditis was 3.32/100,000 person-years, with males at higher risk than females and in 2007, the incidence of acute pericarditis in one study was 27.2 cases per 100,000 per year. Treatment for myocarditis and pericarditis may vary considerably depending on the patient characteristics, clinical condition, underlying cause, and physician preference. Consistent with a known male preponderance of myocarditis and pericarditis, all seven of our cases were male. The Pfizer-BioNTech clinical trials demonstrated an increased systemic reactogenicity and immunogenicity in younger study participants following mRNA vaccine. For example, 41.5% of adolescents developed chills after dose #2, compared to 35.1% of subjects 18-55 years of age. In terms of immunogenicity, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers 1 month after dose#2 demonstrated higher geometric mean titer (GMT) in children 12-15 years of age (GMT=1,239.5), compared to subjects 16-25 years of age (GMT=705.1). Adverse events often occurred more frequently after dose #2 and within 2 days following vaccination and included injection site pain, fatigue, myalgia, chills, arthralgia, fever, injection site swelling or redness, nausea, malaise, and lymphadenopathy. It is possible that myocarditis or myopericarditis may be an additional rare adverse event related to systemic reactogenicity, but currently no causal association has been established between this vaccine and myopericarditis. In our case series, 6 patients received non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment. Four patients received IVIG and oral prednisone; one of these four patients also initially received high-dose methylprednisolone. The recognition of a possible temporal relationship of COVID-19 vaccine and myocarditis is critical, because the correct diagnosis may spare healthy adolescents and young adults presenting with chest pain and ECG ST elevation from undergoing unnecessary invasive medical procedures such as cardiac catheterization. It is unclear if treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and/or corticosteroids, in the absence of MIS-C criteria, is warranted with all cases of myocarditis that develop temporally after COVID-19 vaccination. Notably, 3 patients recovered with NSAID therapy alone. Myocarditis and myopericarditis after COVID-19 vaccination appear rare. As of 23May2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that 1,560,652 people <18 years of age have completed a two-dose series of COVID-19 vaccine17. Of these, 652, 758 adolescents received their second dose more than fourteen days ago17. Currently, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is the only COVID-19 vaccine authorized for children <18 years of age in the US. We urge physicians and healthcare providers to consider myocarditis in the evaluation of adolescents and young adults who develop chest pain after COVID-19 vaccination. All cases of myocarditis in patients with recent COVID-19 vaccination should be reported promptly to VAERS. Our case series has inherent limitations. We compiled cases through personal communications between colleagues rather than using a systematic surveillance system to identify cases. It was not possible to exclude all alternative etiologies including idiopathic and other infectious etiologies, and there was not a systematic diagnostic evaluation for other viral etiologies. Cardiac biopsy was not performed on any patients, because they were all clinically stable during hospitalization. However, no patient had evidence of a preceding or concurrent symptomatic viral illness to implicate as an etiology of myocarditis, and the lack of eosinophilia dissuades a hypersensitivity reaction. The pathophysiology of myocarditis in these patients is indeterminate and we do not know if it is the same or different than classic myopericarditis or myopericarditis following other vaccines, associated with acute COVID-19, or MIS-C. Given the nature of a case series, we cannot determine the incidence rate of myocarditis/myopericarditis following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. Finally, a negative nucleocapsid antibody does not conclusively rule out the possibility of natural infection. This report summarizes a series of US cases of myocarditis and myopericarditis following the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in adolescent males. All cases in this report occurred after the second vaccine dose. Fortunately, none of our patients was critically ill and each was discharged home. At present, there is no definite causal relationship between these cases and vaccine administration.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender's Comments: Based on chronological connection to the vaccine causality between reported event acute myocarditis and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine cannot be completely excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.,Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021665013 Same reporter, drug, event but different patient",,,,,Y,3.0,,,U,,,,"Test Name: Partial thromboplastin time; Test Result:  27.9 s; Test Name: Alanine transaminase; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:22 IU/l; Comments: (units/L); Test Name: COVID-19 nucleocapsid antibody; Test Result: Negative  ; Test Name: Antibody test; Test Result: Positive  ; Comments: antibody testing showed positive spike and negative nucleocapsid antibodies for SARS-CoV-2; Test Name: Aspartate transaminase; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:59; Comments: (units/L); Test Name: Albumin; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:3.8 g/dl; Test Name: BMI; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:22; Test Name: NT pro-BNP; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:149 pg/mL; Test Name: C-reactive protein; Test Result:  1.5 mg/dl; Test Name: Highest C-reactive protein; Test Result:  1.8 mg/dl; Test Name: Cytomegalovirus Disagnostics; Test Result: Negative  ; Test Name: Echocardiogram; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:Normal; Test Name: ECG; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:ST-Elevated; Comments: ST-elevation on ECG but normal function; Test Name: Enterovirus diagnostics; Test Result: Negative  ; Test Name: Epstein-Barr virus Diagnostics; Test Result: Negative  ; Test Name: International Normalized Ratio INR; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:1.06; Test Name: lab test; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:Negative Lyme; Comments: Other diagnostics: Negative Lyme serology, negative Mycoplasma serum PCR, negative Parvovirus serum PCR; Test Name: Absolute lymphocyte count; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:1.4 /mm3; Test Name: MRI; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:demonstrated diffuse edema; Comments: Cardiac MRI demonstrated diffuse edema; Test Name: Absolute neutrophil; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:2.8 /mm3; Test Name: Platelet count; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:189 /mm3; Test Name: Mycoplasma serum PCR; Test Result: Negative  ; Test Name: Respiratory pathogen panel PCR; Test Result: Negative  ; Test Name: Prothrombin time; Test Result:  11.4 s; Test Name: Erythrocyte sedimentation rate; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:3; Comments: (mm/hr); Test Name: COVID-19 spike antibody; Test Result: Positive  ; Test Name: Nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR; Test Result: Negative  ; Test Name: Ferritin; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:65 ug/L; Test Name: Highest troponin; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:0.82 ng/ml; Test Name: Lowest troponin prior to Discharge; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:0.01 ng/ml; Test Name: Elevated troponin T; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:0.66 ng/ml; Comments: Evaluation in the ED showed an elevated troponin T (0.66 ng/mL, normal range, <0.01 ng/mL); Test Name: Peripheral white blood cell count; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:5.0 /mm3",UNK,,,,,,USPFIZER INC2021665019,2,06/18/2021,,,,,myocarditis,G2,?,M,?,Trop 0.82->0.82 (peak 0.82); ST elevation; Cardiac MRI+,Viral etiology,"Age unknown male presented with chest pain, fever unknown interval after 2nd dose.

He said these heart symptoms related to the second vaccine could fade over time.  Hiking trip May 20th to May 30th.  Did fine with exertion and just a few small episodes of the chest pain, light headedness and maybe a little shaking but these were at rest.  Also, 4 lead heart monitor report was good.  Returned from trip May 30th and no chest pain or symptoms for approximately 3 weeks through June 17th.   June 18th went to urgent care for sore throat and ear.  Prescribed amoxycillin.  Took the amoxycillin and one Advil sinus, that evening had a heart squeezing episode return.  This was the first time in almost 3 weeks.  Did not take any more Advil sinus in case that caused the episode. Had another slight episode that evening.  Hiked next day June 19th and fine.

I got the first Moderna shot April 13. On April 22 I had some chest tightness which I attributed to the Diflucan as it listed chest tightness as a side effect. On May 2nd the pain extended from the chest, neck, headache and all my teeth hurt and I ended up in the hospital for the first of 3 hospitalizations  Below is the summary of doctor?s notes on my hospitalizations.  They ran several tests to eliminate lupus, sjogrens, cancer, kidney issues, bacterial or fungus issues, etc.  It was not caused by the Diflucan side effect. They decided it might be viral.  Given the current report of some people getting pericarditis after the vaccine, my doctor and I felt we should report this incident.  Given the timing, it could have been the vaccine that caused the reaction.  I'm currently on prednisone for another month and colchicine for several more months and remain under the care of cardiology.   SUMMARY OF DOCTOR?S NOTES:   She presented to the ER 5/2/2021 with chest pain. When she presented, she had tachycardia with interior ST changes. CT showed no PE but there was a large pericardial effusion. Subsequently her blood pressure began dropping with narrowing pulse pressure and she was thought to have early tamponade physiology so was taken to the cath lab and pericardiocentesis was performed. She did well and was started on colchicine and ibuprofen.   5/14 When I saw her back, she was doing well. Since then, she has had back to back admissions:   5/24/2021-5/27/2021-CAP of LLL with bilateral pleural effusions and pericarditis treated with antibiotics but afterwards, felt to be viral. She was seen by Pulmonary at this hospital stay. Rheumatologist work up was started. ECHO was stable.  5/29 Second Moderna shot (was delayed 2 weeks due to concern about confusing the potential normal side effects with the pericarditis issues).    6/13/2021-6/15/2021-Serositis with tachycardia, cough and fever. Rheumatology did not see but was curb sided and recommended Prednisone (long taper) with clinic visit in the next 2 weeks. Limited ECHO was stable.     6/16 Patient is doing well. No chest pain.

Initially, while I didn't feel like I was feeling stressed, I was concerned that I might be experiencing panic attacks.  Dismissing it as that I shared with my Husband my concerns in late February. At that point in time, we were seeing a decrease in cases and so I was hopeful that maybe my mental state and anxieties might resolve.  So I continued to dismiss the problem. Disease Progression:  Unfortunately, the symptoms continued to progress. It progressed to happening when I was leaving work or when it was required that I go anywhere in an real rush (a frequent occurrence). By early April, we went for a family vacation.  Almost every day as we walked into, around and out of the parks I would have to slow down and res to catch my breath and slow my heartrate which would spike up into the 140-160s.  By the end of the week it was happening multiple times each day. It was always initiated by an increase in activity or exertion.  We decided that it was not anxiety related and that she needed to see a doctor to pursue a diagnosis.   4/12/21: Due to already having an appointment set up with my OB/GYN prior to our vacation - that was the first appointment that I kept because I was hopeful or suspicious that my symptoms may really be menopausal in source. The hormone work-up did not reveal any abnormalities.  However, at that time they did send in a referral to  Dr., Cardiologist. 5/17/21: I met with Dr. at which an Echo and NM Stress test were ordered.   5/28/21: Echo & routine stress test were completed.  Insurance would not cover an actual NM Stress test so the order was changed to routine.  I failed the treadmill stress test within  4.42 minutes with the same symptoms I had been experiencing. Test was terminated due to worsening symptoms. , took approximately 10 minutes to recover. HR reached goal HR @ 157. At that time Dr. recommended starting a daily Aspirin tx and suggested that a possible heart cath may be needed. Dr. followed up these tests with a referral for a left heart cath, daily 81mg Aspirin and 12.5mg Metoprolol XR daily. During this almost 3 week time period my symptoms were getting increasingly worse and requiring less and less activity to instigate my symptoms.   6/15/21: Left heart catheterization procedure to evaluate the blood flow to the heart.  Impression and plan per Dr.   Impression:   Severe ostial RCA and left main disease with preserved LV systolic function.   Crescendo angina      Plan:   Findings were reviewed the patient and her family.   Ostial coronary disease raise the concern whether she had some type of aortitis but clinically there is no history for this and no prior chest irradiation.   Surgical intervention appears indicated as soon as possible and I have consulted Dr.   In the interim, continue aspirin, metoprolol. Initiate statin therapy.  (The remainder of the following record as documented by my husband and myself) They completed the procedure and it indicated two of the main blood vessels in her heart were constricted.  The vessel on the right side was 95% restricted and the vessel on the left was 65-70% restricted.  The doctors reported afterward that they had difficulty inserting the catheter.  They also indicated that they found no build-up of plaque in other vessels or other reasons for the vessels to be restricted.  They expressed surprise and confusion as to the cause of the damage to the vessels.  They walked through the risk factors and indicated that she had none of the traditional risk factors.  She never smoked.  She is not diabetic.  She is young and otherwise healthy.  They told us that they see this type of damage to the heart from people who had radiation therapy from treatment of Hodgkin?s Lymphoma when they were young.  They also indicated that this is something that can happen to Type 1 diabetics.  They expressed that this was very unusual and they did not know why she had this condition.  They felt there was a high risk of a heart attack due to the blockage and recommended that she be admitted to the hospital.  The proposed a course of treatment was traditional bypass surgery.  They felt due to the location and type of blockage that other procedures like a stent would not be feasible.   It was at this point in the consult room when the doctor shared the information above that I express my first question about whether this could be related either to a Covid infection (she was never diagnosed or had any symptoms) or due to the vaccine.  I asked this because the symptoms began after her second shot.  Because of her job we followed the news on the virus and vaccines closely.  Many reports indicated that the virus causes severe heart and lung damage.  Recently there were reports of inflammation of the heart associated with people who had recently been vaccinated.   When I proposed this connection, Dr said that the Myocarditis and Pericarditis reported to be associated with the vaccine did not present in this way.  He expressed that he did not think it was related.   Patient came out of the procedure and was admitted.  Later that evening Dr. came in to discuss the upcoming heart procedure.  He described the blockage and why it was critical that it be addressed.  He also expressed surprise that she was having this issue and did not have any of the normal symptoms of heart disease.  He described the surgery as a triple bypass to restore blood flow to the two sides of the heart affected by the blockage.  He indicated he would take a vein from her arm and a vein from her leg and bypass the affected areas of the restricted vessels.  It was not clear to me (we did not have any pictures or models to visualize the process) exactly how it would proceed but he said it is a very common procedure and of the bypass surgeries it is the easiest due to the location.  He did not expect any issues and indicated it was a 99% success rate.   In the conversation, he expressed multiple times that this was very unusual.  I asked if it was possible it could be Covid or vaccine related.  He did not believe it was related. 6/16/21 Wednesday patient spent the day being prepped for surgery.  Vein mapping, ABG, CXR completed. 6/17/21 Thursday morning, she went into surgery.  We received the updates with no indication of any issues.  After surgery Dr. came in for the post op consult.  He said that things did not go as planned.  They harvested the veins in preparation.  When they went in the ascending aorta was severely inflamed.  He said that normal thickness is a millimeter and that it is flexible.  Patient had a 6mm wall thickness and was very difficult to work with.  This caused them to only bypass 2 vessels.  He indicated he was concerned about attaching to the inflamed aorta and that it was very difficult to ensure the stitches went all the way through.  He was worried about the efficacy of the connection.  He also stated that the inflammation was unusual and that it was possible that if they had earlier diagnosed the inflammation as the cause of the restriction it might have been possible to avoid surgery and treating the inflammation would have cleared the restrictions on the vessels.  I asked again if this might be related either to Covid or to the vaccine.  This time he said that he did not know and that he would consult with others.  He also reported that he took a small part of the aorta out and had sent it to the lab for testing.  He did not indicate which tests they would do or what they were looking for specifically.    Operative Findings - per Dr. notes in MyChart:   1. The entire ascending aorta was noted to be significantly inflamed and thickened. The thickness of the aorta was noted to be approximately 5 to 6 mm in thickness. Because of the thickened aortic leaflets very hard to place an aortic cannula, antegrade catheter and placement of the proximal graft. Initially the plan was to do 2 bypasses to the left system 1 to the left anterior descending artery using the internal mammary artery and vein to the first obtuse marginal branch using a saphenous vein. Because of the inflammatory condition of the aorta it was decided to place only 1 bypass using the left internal mammary artery to the left system. This was done to avoid any unnecessary manipulation of the ascending aorta. The above-mentioned findings are consistent with aortitis.  2. The left anterior descending artery was noted with approximately 2 mm in diameter.  3. The distal right coronary artery was noted to be approximately 2.5 mm in diameter but slightly inflamed.  Patient made it to her ICU room (436) and late Thursday evening was extubated and went for a CT to see if they could see the inflammation.  That night she had to go on Bipap to help her oxygenation.   Per lab work - became very acidotic requiring Bipap post extubation that evening. 6/18/21: Friday, she continued Bipap to maintain oxygenation.  She had a heart rate issue late in the morning and had to have a pace maker attached.  Dr came back on Friday and said that he had talked to other doctors and they were going to refer patient to a Rheumatologist at OSU to evaluate if she has an autoimmune disease.   2 U RBCs for low Hgb. No s/s of active bleeding  6/19/21: Saturday went smoothly. She came off Bipap.  She was able to get up and walk out to the hall.   Chest Tubes, Cordis and foley removed. TR to SE6 stepdown unit.  Restarted on beta blocker 6/20/21: Sunday She went to the bathroom and got cleaned up.  The nurse changed the dressings on her incisions.   6/22/21: Echo completed. Ambulated in the hall.

This author reported similar events for 5 patients. This is the 1st of 5 reports.   Myopericarditis has been reported as a rare vaccination complication. There presented a case series of 7 patients hospitalized for acute myocarditis-like illness following COVID-19 vaccination. Six patients received mRNA (Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech) and 1 received the adenovirus (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine. All patients presented 3-7 days post vaccination with acute onset chest pain and biochemical evidence of myocardial injury, by cardiac troponin I (Address withheld) (mean peak = 15.77ng/mL, median peak = 12.01ng/mL), or elevated high sensitivity troponin I (Address withheld) (peak=7000ng/L). All were hemodynamically stable and none had a pericardial friction rub or rash. Electrocardiogram (ECG) patterns varied from normal to ST segment elevation. Three patients underwent invasive coronary angiography and none had evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease. Echocardiograms showed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ranging from 35% to 62% with 5/7 having some degree of hypokinesis. Patients underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) between 3 and 37 days after vaccination, including multiplanar SSFP sequences, short axis T1 and T2 stacks, T1 mapping when available and multiplanar myocardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Multi-focal subepicardial LGE was present in 7/7 patients and additional mid-myocardial LGE was demonstrated in 4/7 patients. There was corresponding myocardial edema in 3/7 patients. Two patients who underwent CMR> 7 days from presentation had no edema, with an additional patient's T2 images limited by artifact. One patient underwent endomyocardial biopsy without pathological evidence of myocarditis. None reported palpitations and there was no evidence of sustained arrhythmias. None had evidence of an active viral illness or autoimmune disease and 6/7 had PCR testing for acute COVID-19 infection during hospitalization, which was negative. Assessment of COVID-19 serology was obtained for 6/7 patients, with 4/6 showing presence of spike protein IgG antibodies.  Treatment varied and included beta-blocker and anti-inflammatory medication. Hospital length of stay was 3 plus or minus 1 days and all patients' symptoms resolved by hospital discharge. All cases were re-ported to the vaccine adverse event reporting system (VAERS) and the CDC.  A 39-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 (BNT162b2) vaccine), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient's medical history was not reported. Denied history of prior COVID-19 infection, Negative PCR. The patient's concomitant medications were not reported. The patient presented symptoms as Sudden onset 7/10 chest pain 2days after vaccine, associated with shortness of breath, Worse when lying flat and with inspiration.

Clinical Course: The patient hospitalized for 4 days and received treatment as beta-blocker (BB), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), Statin. The outcome of event was unknown.  Our series of 7 male COVID-19 vaccination recipients who presented with myocarditis-like illness supports a potential causal association with vaccination given the temporal relationship, clinical presentation and CMR findings. The clinical course of vaccine-associated myocarditis-like illness appears favorable, with resolution of symptoms in all patients. Given the potential morbidity of COVID-19 infection even in younger adults, the risk-benefit decision for vaccination remains highly favorable. Vaccine adverse event reporting remains of high importance and further studies are needed to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanism to potentially identify or prevent future occurrences.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected; Information about batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender's Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Heart injury cannot be excluded.

Echocardiograms showed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ranging from 35% to 62% with 5/7 having some degree of hypokinesis. Patients underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) between 3 and 37 days after vaccination, including multiplanar SSFP sequences, short axis T1 and T2 stacks, T1 mapping when available and multiplanar myocardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Multi-focal subepicardial LGE was present in 7/7 patients and additional mid-myocardial LGE was demonstrated in 4/7 patients. There was corresponding myocardial edema in 3/7 patients. Two patients who underwent CMR> 7 days from presentation had no edema, with an additional patient's T2 images limited by artifact. One patient underwent endomyocardial biopsy without pathological evidence of myocarditis. None reported palpitations and there was no evidence of sustained arrhythmias. None had evidence of an active viral illness or autoimmune disease and 6/7 had PCR testing for acute COVID-19 infection during hospitalization, which was negative. Assessment of COVID-19 serology was obtained for 6/7 patients, with 4/6 showing presence of spike protein IgG antibodies.  Treatment varied and included beta-blocker and anti-inflammatory medication. Hospital length of stay was 3 plus or minus 1 days and all patients' symptoms resolved by hospital discharge. All cases were re-ported to the vaccine adverse event reporting system (VAERS) and the CDC.  A 20-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 (BNT162b2) vaccine), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included: History of prior COVID-19 infection. The patient's concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced myocardial injury/acute myocarditis-like illness on an unspecified date. Presenting Symptoms: Mid-sternal chest pain, with deep inspiration. The patient was hospitalized for myocardial injury/acute myocarditis-like illness for 4 days. Days from administration to presentation: 3 Days. On unknown date, negative COVID-19 PCR; Vital Signs at Presentation: Temperature (C): 37.9, Heart Rate (bpm): 112, Blood Pressure (mmHg): 121/78, Respirations (per min): 18; CXR findings: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease; EKG findings: unknown results, ST changes: 1mm ST elevation V2-5, Rhythm: Sinus Tachycardia; Echocardiogram: 5 days post vaccine, LVEF: 50-55%, LVIDd: 4.34cm, IVS: 1.1cm, RWMA: Mild hypokinesis in the mid to distal anteroseptum and apex, Diastolic function: Normal; Cardiac MRI: 6 days post vaccine, LVEF: 52% (Subtle apical septal and apical lateral hypokinesis, LGE: Subepicardial LGE within the lateral, inferolateral, and anterolateral walls with global left ventricular apex.

Treatment(s): ibuprofen, famotidine. The outcome of event was unknown.  The clinical course of vaccine-associated myocarditis-like illness appears favorable, with resolution of symptoms in all patients. Given the potential morbidity of COVID-19 infection even in younger adults, the risk-benefit decision for vaccination remains highly favorable. Vaccine adverse event reporting remains of high importance and further studies are needed to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanism to potentially identify or prevent future occurrences.

There was no medical history or concomitant medications. There was no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The patient received the first dose and after he had a horrible reaction and he had to go to the hospital. By 03May2021 he was in the ER and they were saying he had a heart attack; they were going to do emergency surgery to place a stent in his heart; but when they did the tests they found that a virus had caused the heart attack; he had myocarditis. Add then he had various medical care to keep him alive those two days. The doctor confirmed that he had myocarditis from a virus. He was still on mediation for his heart. The patient also mentioned his memory comes and goes now. Mentions the beta blocker his is prescribed is Metoprolol 25mg. Adds he was instructed to take one half of a 25mg tablet and then move up to 25mg, but he blacked out for a day when he took the 25mg, so he had to go back to one half of 25mg. Adds his heart races really fast and he has to have this medication to control it. He is also taking 81mg ASPIRIN. He was taking Atorvastatin 20mg once daily, but the other doctor told him to stop it because it is not doing him any good.

The did two COVIDs tests that were negative. Blood tests that showed the heart attack need for a stent; but when they got in there with the camera it showed he had a viral attack on his heart that caused the blood flow to slow; EKG abnormal, mentions an MRI; and troponin level off the charts. The priest came in to talk to him and he had a horrible cough that has now gone away. He was in the hospital overnight and discharged 04May2021 at 15:00. After that he noticed he feels light chest pain/pressure all the time on 04May2021; the first week he was foggy on 04May2021 and had severe headache on 04May2021 and noticed about 20% loss of memory. The patient mentioned he made medical heart parts at work and he went back to work on 10May2021 but he just sat at his bench and examined the parts. He thought the vaccine activated his really good immune system and caused it to attack his heart. He had another EKG and the doctor said his right ventricle is damaged in his heart last week. Mentions he has had at least 30 different blood tests. Everyday for three weeks he thought he was going to die but his doctor did give him some hope. The event was hospitalized for myocarditis from a virus, heart attack and extreme pain in his head, back, shoulder, arms, and lungs feeling crushed from 03May2021 to 04May2021 at 15:00.

This author reported similar event for two patients. This is second of two reports.   A 34-year-old female without prior medical history presented 9 days after her first vaccine dose. On day 4 after vaccine, she developed fevers, cough, chest pain, nausea, and vomiting. She presented to another institution with hypotension and sinus tachycardia, an echocardiogram showed severely reduced LVEF of 15%. Cardiac catheterization showed no obstructive coronary artery disease. She was transferred for initiation of VA-ECMO. On admission, she was in severe shock requiring multiple vasopressors. CRP, ferritin and CK-MB were elevated at 5.6 mg/dL, >30,000 ng/mL, and 42.4 ng/mL, respectively. VA-ECMO and RRT were initiated. Treatment was initiated with methylprednisolone 1000 mg daily and continued for 3 days followed by a slow taper over, with IVIG 30 mg daily for 4 days, and anakinra 100 mg daily. Lactic acid 13 mmol/ L on admission normalized within 24 h of ECMO onset, INR improved from 4.5 to 1.7. Interleukin-6 level was mildly elevated at 17 pg/mL and interleukin-2 soluble receptor alpha was 1067 U/mL (NV less than 710). Thrombocytopenia was noted at 106x10 9 /L which persisted for several days. ALI was noted with ALT and AST at 14,477 and 6086 u/L which steadily improved thereafter. PCR for SARS-CoV2 and other common respiratory viruses was negative. SARS-CoV2 spike protein IgG antibody was positive (64 arbitrary units/ml), and IgG anti-nucleocapsid was negative, consistent with immunization due to vaccine without prior infection. Vasopressors were weaned off, LVEF was documented at 50% by transthoracic echocardiography, VA-ECMO was discontinued. She was treated with prednisone 1 mg/kg and anakinra with prednisone tapered first (by reducing 0.1 mg every week) and tapering anakinra planned after prednisone is discontinued. An endomyocardial biopsy performed on day 13 of hospital admission, after recovery of cardiac function and near resolution of the systemic hyperinflammation, showed cardiomyocytes with minute foci of cytoplasmic vacuolization and rare interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate, which is consistent with healing myocarditis, but did not meet conventional diagnostic criteria for acute myocarditis. A cardiac catheterization at the same time showed preservation of cardiac output and normal filling pressures. A cardiac magnetic resonance, performed 45 days after the initial presentation, showed LVEF of 35%, diffuse elevation of native T1 values, small pericardial effusion with enhancement of the pericardium anterior and anterolaterally and small patchy areas of enhancement following delayed imaging after gadolinium in the mid-wall of the anterior wall, consistent with myopericarditis. Genetic testing for 121 genes showed no variants associated with genetic disorders. Guideline-directed heart failure treatment was also initiated. She was discharged from the hospital after 73 days. In summary, both cases presented features of fulminant myocarditis with a temporal association with the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccination, in absence of other apparent causes, and with unique features of systemic hyperinflammation associated with refractory shock. These cases identify the need for awareness of a potential, albeit extremely rare, link of BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccination associated with fulminant myocarditis as part of a severe systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome, requiring mechanical cardiac support and, most importantly, immunosuppressive therapy. The degree of the inflammatory biomarkers and multiorgan dysfunction seen in the two cases described, as in some patients with Covid-19, is indeed out of proportion to with hemodynamic failure and shock and it is not rapidly resolved by cardiac mechanical support, reflecting a significant degree of vasoplegia. The optimal immunosuppressive treatment for systemic hyperinflammation associated with fulminant myocarditis is unknown. They chose a combination of high dose methylprednisolone, IVIG and anakinra (Table 1) as a strategy used across a variety of immunologic and rheumatologic diseases characterized with inappropriate macrophage activation. Table 1 Key biomarkers at admission and immunomodulating therapy: Patient #2: Presentation included: Symptoms: Fever, cough, chest pain, nausea and vomiting. Vaccine type was BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19. Timing was 9 days after 1st dose. Hemodynamics included Hypotension and tachycardia. ECG : Non-specific changes. Echocardiogram: LVEF 15%. Biomarkers included: CRP : 5.6 mg/dl; Interleukin: 17.2 pg/ml [12 h after therapy]; Ferritin : greater than 30,000 ng/ml; INR : 4.5; D-dimer : greater than 20 ug/ml; Lactic acid : 13 mmol/l; CK-MB : 42 ng/ml; SARS-CoV2 spike IgG : 64 a.u./ml; SARS-CoV2 NC IgG : negative. Immunosuppressive therapy included: Methylprednisolone : 1000 mg daily for 3 days, followed by a slow prednisone taper over several weeks; Immunoglobulins : 30 mg daily for 4 days; Anakinra : 100 mg daily. Outcome was Recovering, minimal symptoms, LVEF 35%, delayed enhancement after gadolinium at cardiac magnetic resonance; discharged from the hospital after 73 days.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

This author reported similar events for eight patients. This is the fourth of eight reports.  The authors describe clinical characteristics of 8 adolescents who presented over the course of 36 days to (Hospital) with perimyocarditis within 4 days of receiving a dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. A 15-year-old male with Marfan syndrome and aortic root dilation presented to the ED with sudden onset of retrosternal chest pain, fatigue, and abdominal pain for 1 day. He denied fever, shortness of breath, or recent illness. The patient had a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection in January 2021 with mild symptoms. He had received the first dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine 3 days prior to admission. In the ED, his troponin was 7.2 ng/ mL and ECG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with no other changes. Chest X-ray was normal. The peak troponin level was 11.8 ng/mL. Pain resolved while he was still in ED. The patient was asymptomatic at the time of admission. TTE showed patent foramen ovale, mild mitral valve prolapses with mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, mild aortic root dilation (unchanged), and qualitatively low normal LVSF. Cardiac MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) was significant for focal edema at the basal inferolateral segments, normal biventricular size and global systolic function, and stable aortic root dilation. The patient had 12- and 8-beat runs of irregular polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. The runs occurred within 1 minute of each other, and the patient was asymptomatic at the time. He remained hemodynamically stable. Infectious workup was negative, including adenovirus plasma PCR, CMV antibodies, enterovirus plasma PCR, EBV titers, Leptospira IgM, Parvovirus B19 PCR, and RPP (Respiratory viral panel).

Herein described is the first case series from a single institution of 8 adolescent males with a diagnosis of perimyocarditis in the setting of recent BNT162b2 vaccination with no other identifiable cause. Pediatricians should consider myocarditis in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with chest pain after receiving the BNT162b2 vaccine and be aware of the clinical implications and the need to report this potential adverse event. Currently, the association between perimyocarditis and the BNT162b2 vaccine is unproven but recent reports suggest there may be causality. This case series raises additional questions regarding appropriate recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination in adolescents with a prior history of perimyocarditis, of SARS CoV-2 infection (clinically or by serology), and of multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 (MISC). It also poses the issue of whether patients who experience perimyocarditis post-BNT162b2 vaccine should receive booster SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the future.    No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender's Comments: A contributory role of BNT162B2 to the event perimyocarditis cannot be excluded based on the plausible temporal relationship, product safety profile and lack of reported alternative explanation at this time. This case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

On 05-May-2021, C-reactive protein: 63.5 mg/l (High) 63.5 mg/L (reference range: =8.0?mg/L). On 05-May-2021, Cardiac ventriculogram left: 40% (abnormal) showed a mildly reduced ejection fraction of 40% with global hypokinesis that was most severe at the apex. On 05-May-2021, Echocardiogram: abnormal (abnormal) Showed a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction.Demonstrated borderline enlarged left ventricle with an estimated ejection fraction of 4045%, mild-moderate generalized left ventricular hypokinesis, slightly worse at the apex, borderline enlarged right ventricle with mildly-moderately decreased systolic function, and no significant valve disease.. On 05-May-2021, Electrocardiogram: abnormal (abnormal) Electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation in the lateral limb and precordial leads. On 05-May-2021, Eosinophil count (0.03-0.48): 0.04 × 10(9)/l (normal) 0.04 × 10(9)/L. On 05-May-2021, Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure: 29?mmhg (High) markedly elevated at 29?mmHg. On 05-May-2021, Magnetic resonance imaging heart: acute myocarditis (abnormal) was compatible with acute myocarditis with patchy linear mid-myocardial enhancement of the septum and inferior walls at the base to mid-ventricle, sub-epicardial/mid-myocardial enhancement of the lateral wall at the mid-ventricle and apical lateral wall. There was associated myocardial oedema involving most of the myocardium and mild pericardial enhancement. On 05-May-2021, N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide: 1059 pg/ml (High) 1059 pg/mL (reference range: =51?pg/mL). On 05-May-2021, Physical examination: minimal lower extremity swelling (abnormal) showed minimal lower extremity swelling. On 05-May-2021, Red blood cell sedimentation rate (2-2): 12 mm/h (High) 12 mm/h. On 05-May-2021, Troponin T: 847 ng/l (High) 847 ng/L (reference range: =15?ng/L). On 05-May-2021, Vital signs measurement: normal (normal) temperature of 36.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 79 beats per minute, blood pressure of 90/72, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. On 05-May-2021, White blood cell count (3.4-9.6): 9.7 × 10(9)/l (High) 9.7 × 10(9)/L. On 06-May-2021, Echocardiogram: normal (normal) Repeat Transthoracic echocardiogram showing normalization of ejection fraction, and no regional wall motion abnormalities. On 06-May-2021, Troponin T: 675?ng/l (High) decreased to 675?ng/L the day after admission. On an unknown date, Chest X-ray: mild pulmonary oedema (abnormal) showed findings consistent with mild pulmonary oedema. On an unknown date, SARS-CoV-2 test: negative (Negative) Negative (COVID-19 nasal swab testing using polymerase chain reaction was negative).     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown), the reporter considered MYOCARDITIS (Acute myocarditis), MALAISE (Malaise), COUGH (Dry cough), MYALGIA (Myalgias) and HEADACHE (Headache) to be possibly related.    Patient was in his usual state of health prior to getting the second dose of mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine. There was no family history of cardiovascular or autoimmune disease.  Endomyocardial biopsy was not performed as the patient experienced mild symptoms, had no haemodynamic or electrical instability, and responded promptly to initial management.  The patient was started on supportive therapy for the symptoms, including a brief course of intravenous diuretics for mild symptoms of congestion. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a beta-blocker therapy were commenced to treat systolic dysfunction. The patient was also initiated on colchicine to treat mild persistent chest pain, which was thought to be related to pericardial inflammation that resolved 4-5?days after presentation.   The patient was discharged home after 5 days of monitoring without evidence of electrical or haemodynamic instability and with Class I symptoms. One month later, repeat echocardiogram showed normalization of the left ventricular ejection fraction (56%) and size, no regional wall motion abnormalities, and normal longitudinal peak systolic strain. The patient remained asymptomatic and off diuretics.  This case concerns a 44-year-old male patient with a history of Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, Asthma and Obesity, who experienced the serious expected event Myocarditis.
